# Automation Scout Chrome Extension

**Discover your next automation opportunity, right in your browser.**

Automation Scout is a lightweight Chrome Extension designed to help you identify repetitive tasks you perform daily, so you know exactly *what* to automate to save time.

---

### How It Works (Brief)

* **Local Tracking:** Observes your Browse (URLs, titles, visit times) directly within your browser.
* **Pattern Analysis:** Identifies pages or apps you visit frequently.
* **Email Reports:** Sends you a weekly (or daily) email highlighting these patterns and suggesting automation ideas.
* **AI Integration:** Includes a prompt you can use with Gemini (or any LLM) for even deeper, personalized automation insights.

### Privacy & Transparency (Crucial!)

Your privacy is paramount:
* **All raw Browse data is processed and stored exclusively on your device.** It never leaves your browser.
* Only **aggregated and anonymized summary data** (like "visited X website 10 times") is sent to a secure server to generate your email report.
* Your data is **never sold, rented, or shared** with any third parties.
* Read the full [Privacy Policy]([https://automation-scout-backend.vercel.app/privacy.md]) for complete details.
